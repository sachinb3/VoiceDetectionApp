Engineered an application for voiced/unvoiced speech detection, utilizing the Java KISS FFT library and
autocorrelation techniques and trained a voice thresholding value and implemented a 3 stage vocal recognition pipeline for real-time voice signal
processing to determine frequency of voiced segments
